Hello! I am Edgar Refskegg. I live in the kingdom of Atlantia and have
spent much time in the East Kingdom. I began participating in the SCA in
2013 where I attended Ice Castles in the Barony of Black Diamond. I
started off most interested in A&S and that is where I continue today
along with a side of rapier. I dabble in a lot of A&S and my main
interests are research, enameling (and soon more in depth metalworking... I've
definitely opened a can of worms here.), brewing, and various other activities
such as leatherworking. Essentially, if I can learn something new or
help someone else learn, I am happy. 

Here are links to my [Atlantia OP](http://op.atlantia.sca.org/op_ind.php?atlantian_id=9766) and [East Kingdom Wiki](https://wiki.eastkingdom.org/index.php?title=Edgar_Refskegg) pages. Enjoy!
