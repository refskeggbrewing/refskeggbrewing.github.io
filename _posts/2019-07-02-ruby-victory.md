At Ruby Joust I entered a pair of enameled Caer Mear populace badges for the A&S competition and won the Ruby prize for A&S! :D They were super fun to make and people seemed to really enjoy them, which is great. At court after receiving the prize brooch I bestowed upon the barony the enamels! I hope they enjoy them.
