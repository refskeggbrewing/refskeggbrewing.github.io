I've been working more and more on this website inbetween classes and
life stuff. It's coming together to a point where I'm more willing to
share it with others. I've tinkered a lot in the last few years so
there's a lot to add. 

In the mean time, I will be going to a few events in Atlantia in the
next few months with intent to bring enameling and maybe some brewing
products (maybe). I'm always willing to help and chat, so please come
by!
