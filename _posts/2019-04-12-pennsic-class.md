I've signed up to teach at Pennsic! I'm pretty excited, and nervous
because it is my first time teaching or doing anything A&S related
there. I'm really looking forward to it! 

I will be teaching a Champleve enamel class and a lecture about the
Venetian Arsenale. The enamel class will be fairly technical and is
going to focus on how to reproduce medieval Champleve enamel (or enameling in a medieval
style) using modern techniques. It should be pretty fun! The Venetian
Arsenale class will also likely be fun. I did some research for a class
I took last Fall so I wanted to share the knowledge with others. I
focused on the Arsenale and I think it's an interesting topic to learn
about. The Venetian shipbuilding facility was world renowned, and truly
a large part of Venice's power. 

Hope to see you there!
