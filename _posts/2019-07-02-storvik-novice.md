At the Storvik Novice event I entered into the Novice competition. The desire was to enter in at least nine items of similar type to be used to baronial largess. I entered in 12 medallions representative of the Storvik Barony's various awards. They were: Order of the Owl (A&S award), Silver Silkie (Fighting Award), and the Order of the Lozulet (Service). My good friend Letia drew the graphics for me that I used to etch and enamel the medallions, and they turned out amazing.

Ultimately, I won the Novice A&S competition! As a prize I received one of each of the other entries. It was pretty cool. I hope the barony enjoys the medallions!
There were some really great entries at this competition as well. Wooden boxes, some woven trim (tablet and inkle!), necklaces, wooden dolls, a small box, and  (I think that's all). They were excellent!
