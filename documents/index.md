## General

The EZ-doc for Atlantia A&S documentation can be found here: [EZ-Doc](/assets/documents/basic.pdf)  

I have recently begun to use Chicago style footnote citation. It seems to lend itself well to historical papers and research like this.
I try to keep research as detailed as possible. If you'd like to see in more detail how I create the documentation I
use, please look [here](process). 

## Brewing 

Period French Cider Documentation: [Cider](/assets/documents/cider.pdf)

Period Bochet Reproduction: [Bochet](/assets/documents/bochet.pdf)

Raspberry Melomel (period-ish): [Raspberry](/assets/documents/RaspberryMelomel.pdf)

The raspberry melomel is a combination recipe that I kind of hacked
together. I could not find actual resources for a raspberry mead made in
medieval period, but there is a raspberry wine recipe in Digby. I
consider this to be plausible at best until I can find better
documentation.

## Enameling

### Event Documentation 

Enamel documentation used at Clash with Bacchus: [Bacchus](/assets/documents/enamel_clashwbacchus.pdf)

Enameling documentation used at Night in Navarre: [Navarre](../assets/documents/enamel_navarre.pdf) and [Tempranillo](../assets/documents/navarre_grape.pdf)

The documentation for Navarre should have included more information
about the general process of enameling and how what I do differs from
period techniques. Further, I should have also noted that the art was an
original design (by Rajan!) and not directly pulled from an extant
sample. 

In the future I intend to create a sort of boilerplate enameling
documentation binder with pictures and a lot of information. Then in
addition to that, add event specific documentation as I go forward. I
think it'll be a wise move going forward. As of 27 April 2019 that is
currently in progess! ... in fact, it is done! 

My next event is Atlantia's 12th Night where I am going to enter a
Plique-a-Jour style piece inspired by the Merode Cup. See the pictures
[here](/assets/documents/paj_pictures.pdf)
