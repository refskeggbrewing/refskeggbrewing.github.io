## General

* * *

The EZ-doc for Atlantia A&S documentation can be found here: [EZ-Doc](/assets/documents/basic.pdf)  

Because I come from an engineering background, for the most part my documentation is cited using IEEE style citations. I try to keep research as detailed as possible.
If you'd like to see in more detail how I create the documentation I
use, please look [here](process). 

## Brewing 

* * *

Period French Cider Documentation: [Cider](/assets/documents/cider.pdf)
I also have some raspberry mead that I need to add the documentation
for. I have also done a bochet based on a French book from 1390.

## Enameling

* * *

### Event Documentation 

Enamel documentation used at Clash with Bacchus: [Bacchus](/assets/documents/enamel_clashwbacchus.pdf)

Enameling documentation used at Night in Navarre: [Navarre](../assets/documents/enamel_navarre.pdf) and [Tempranillo](../assets/documents/navarre_grape.pdf)

The documentation for Navarre should have included more information
about the general process of enameling and how what I do differs from
period techniques. Further, I should have also noted that the art was an
original design (by Rajan!) and not directly pulled from an extant
sample. 

In the future I intend to create a sort of boilerplate enameling
documentation binder with pictures and a lot of information. Then in
addition to that, add event specific documentation as I go forward. I
think it'll be a wise move going forward.
