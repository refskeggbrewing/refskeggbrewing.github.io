* * *

There are many supplies and tools that are important to creating good enamel
pieces. I will list many of the supplies here that I use for my enamels,
but keep in mind that not all of these will be useful for everyone. I
think that what works for me will not necessarily work for others.
Further, there are typically several different ways to accomplish the
same thing. 

The way this list is organized is by the items used from beginning to
end. I may change this at some point but at first thought it seems
like this way it'll be easier to visualize why the tools are needed and
when they might be useful, rather than having a giant list. 

Lastly, for the most part I will keep the explanations for the supplies
here pretty limited. My intent is that this is simply a list of items,
and their respective uses can be located elsewhere in my procedure
documents.
