## How-To Enamel / Where To Start

This section is going to take some time to write about. In the mean
time, please refer to the documentation pdf files posted in the
[documentation](/documents) section. 

For an overview of my enameling procedure and a brief explanation of the
differences between medieval and modern methods, please see here: [General Enameling Procedure](procedure_general)

We did some experiments with etching. See here to read about it: [Etching](etching)

To-Do:
* Why etch? And, the history of etching
* Pierce Work
* Why Theophilus is great
* Modern reproduction of medieval art. (In Progress)
* Experimentation: 
    * Enameling: different colors in same cell, silver foil
    * Different resists

## Supplies

Certainly supplies are important. Please check out the [Supplies](suppliers) page for purchasing information! 
In the mean time, the main places where I obtain my enameling materials
are:
* Rio Grande
    * Really good for general metalworking and a good place online to
      buy copper
* Contenti
    * Good general jewelry making supplies
* Thompson Enamel
    * As the name implies, enamel resources: enamel, kiln supplies, etc.
