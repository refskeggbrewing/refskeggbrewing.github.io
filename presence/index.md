The feature image on this page is a shot from above the battlefield at
Pennsic. It is not my own, it's from an SCA website. Sadly it seems I
do not have a lot of pictures of the events I've gone to.

I try to get to events on a regular basis. They're fun and I enjoy
hanging out with people and it's always great to engage new experiences.
