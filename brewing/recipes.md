### Lemon Nutmeg Mead

Modern recipe! Ready in approx. one month.

I found this recipe when looking around for SCA Mead recipes. This one
was originally called SMoY Mead (Sir Michael of York, who's the one that
created this recipe), but for simplicity's sake I generally just call it
Lemon Nutmeg Mead. 

This is a mead that pretty much everyone loves. It's light, fizzy, and
incredibly flavorful. Further, it's really easy to make. 

On my next iteration of this recipe I'm going to skip the skimming part
all together and simply heat the honey a bit to steeping temperature for
the lemons and nutmegs. I think it'll be less maintenance up front and
yield similar results. We shall see...

#### Ingredients

* 1 Gallon Water
* 2 Lemons
* 2.5 lbs Honey (I like Blueberry Honey from Fruitwood Orchards a lot. Really flavorful.)
* 3 nutmegs, chopped
* 1 pkg Ale yeast 
    * Since the intent of this is fairly low alcohol and a really quick
      turn around (1 month), using ale yeast works best. I prefer Safale
      S-33 for this one. 

#### Procedure

* Add the honey to one gallon of water and bring it to a boil. 
* Skim off the foam that boils up, and keep boiling until it stops foaming, approximately 30 minutes. 
* Slice or juice the lemons and add along with the nutmeg. 
* Mix well, turn off the heat and let stand covered until cooled to yeast pitching temp
* Pour into a gallon jug and add the yeast 
* Ferment two weeks, then siphon into bottles
    * Let the yeast continue to do their work a bit in the bottles in order to carbonate the mead
* After two weeks in the bottle, refrigerate them
    * This is especially important because the yeast will continue to ferment and pressurize the bottle. Too much pressure will cause explosions. I prefer using swing top bottles for this reason.
