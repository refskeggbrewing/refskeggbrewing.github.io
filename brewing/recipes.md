### Traditional Mead

Traditional meads are awesome and really allow the quality of the
brewer and the ingredients to shine in an unadulterated way. Further,
good quality traditionals provide an excellent base mead for melomels,
metheglins, etc.

My favorite way to make a complex mead is to start with a traditional
and let it ferment to completion. Then afterward, start mixing in fruit
purees, spices, or whatever might sound good. One thing that makes mead
so fun is that one can do almost whatever they want with it to create
something interesting. 

I generally use a ratio of 3 lbs of honey per gallon of water. This is
generally considered a medium sweet blend. The honey can be scaled up or
down depending on the desired outcome, but I've found that this ratio
provides the best range of results.

#### Ingredients

* 3lbs Blueberry Honey 
    * Honey style doesn't really matter, but different ones will impart different flavors
* 1 gallon of water
    * If making five gallons for example, scale accordingly.
    * Also, what I usually do is base my water volume off of my target OG. Typically with this mead I go for 1.110 OG, and add water to the honey until it's met.
* 1 L or so of a yeast starter. 
    * I follow Ken Schramm's procedure for making a yeast starter. In a 2L soda bottle or erlenmeyer flask, add some DME, honey, and water, then heat to sterilize. Cool to 70 F and pitch yeast. Place an airlock and let sit overnight or so.
    * Having a hearty yeast starter, in my experience, is really important for making quality mead. Honey isn't easy to ferment for yeast, so having a huge colony takes a lot of stress off.

#### Procedure

* Combine the ingredients into a proper sized carboy and stir, shake, etc. until everything is well mixed.
* Ensure the mix is proper yeast pitching temperature (between 60-70 F or so) and pitch the yeast starter
* Add an airlock and let it go. With a good  yeast starter the airlock should see activity fairly quickly

### Lemon Nutmeg Mead

Modern recipe! Ready in approx. one month.

I found this recipe when looking around for SCA Mead recipes. This one
was originally called SMoY Mead (Sir Michael of York, who's the one that
created this recipe), but for simplicity's sake I generally just call it
Lemon Nutmeg Mead. 

This is a mead that pretty much everyone loves. It's light, fizzy, and
incredibly flavorful. Further, it's really easy to make. 

On my next iteration of this recipe I'm going to skip the skimming part
all together and simply heat the honey a bit to steeping temperature for
the lemons and nutmegs. I think it'll be less maintenance up front and
yield similar results. We shall see...

#### Ingredients

* 1 Gallon Water
* 2 Lemons
* 2.5 lbs Honey (I like Blueberry Honey from Fruitwood Orchards a lot. Really flavorful.)
* 3 nutmegs, chopped
* 1 pkg Ale yeast 
    * Since the intent of this is fairly low alcohol and a really quick
      turn around (1 month), using ale yeast works best. I prefer Safale
      S-33 for this one. 

#### Procedure

* Add the honey to one gallon of water and bring it to a boil. 
* Skim off the foam that boils up, and keep boiling until it stops foaming, approximately 30 minutes. 
* Slice or juice the lemons and add along with the nutmeg. 
* Mix well, turn off the heat and let stand covered until cooled to yeast pitching temp
* Pour into a gallon jug and add the yeast 
* Ferment two weeks, then siphon into bottles
    * Let the yeast continue to do their work a bit in the bottles in order to carbonate the mead
* After two weeks in the bottle, refrigerate them
    * This is especially important because the yeast will continue to ferment and pressurize the bottle. Too much pressure will cause explosions. I prefer using swing top bottles for this reason.
