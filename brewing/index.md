The one pictured to the left of me in the banner is my good friend
Osric from the Barony of Bhakail in the East Kingdom. He's an excellet
brewer and friend.

I've been fermenting various liquids since 2011 when my cello teacher
pointed me to a local home brew shop. They set me up with a bunch of
awesome equipment and provided a really great launch point for me to get
started. It's been a lot of fun, and through many failures I've arrived
at where I'm at presently. 

These days I mostly make mead as it's fairly quick and straightforward
to put together. Additionally, traditional meads provide a wonderful
base for almost any flavor. I enjoy it greatly.

Please read the [resources](resources) page for information on where to
get started with brewing both modern and medieval. This will also
include suppliers of various sorts and general notes on what I think of
them.
